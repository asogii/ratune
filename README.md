# Ratune

A terminal music player for Subsonic-compatible servers.
Built in Rust with [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui), featuring  album art graphics (including in tmux), gapless playback, fuzzy finder support, and a highly configurable UI.

**Why Ratune?**

Ratune was built to bring together a combination of features often missing from Subsonic players: fuzzy navigation, a visually rich UI with album art, deep customization, and a fully terminal-based workflow. Many players excel at a few of these. Ratune aims to cover them all.

- **Album Art**: Display using Kitty graphics and [ratatui-image](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui-image) (see link for compatible terminals)
- **Lyrics**: Synced lyrics via LRCLib when available.
- **Visualizer**: FFT spectrum analyzer.
- **Fuzzy finder**: Optional library index + external picker (fzf/skim) for fast track selection.
- **Folder navigation**: Optional Browse layout that follows server music folders for servers that provide it.
- **Customization**: Keybinds, theme, layout, now-playing lines, queue row template inspired by ncmpcpp.
- **Integration**: Linux MPRIS (media keys, `playerctl`).

---

## Requirements

### Runtime (prebuilt binary or any install)

These apply whenever you run Ratune, including [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/acmagn/ratune/releases) assets.

- **Server**: A Subsonic-compatible music server (Navidrome is a good default).
- **Linux audio**: ALSA userspace library at runtime — e.g. Debian/Ubuntu `libasound2`, Fedora `alsa-lib`, Arch `alsa-lib`. (You do **not** need `-dev` / `*-devel` packages just to run a prebuilt binary.)
- **macOS audio**: Uses Core Audio via the system toolchain; no separate audio library install for typical use.
- **Optional**: `fzf` or `sk` on `PATH` if you use the library fuzzy picker (see `[library]` in the sample config).

Prebuilt archives on [Releases](https://github.com/acmagn/ratune/releases): **Linux x86_64** (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`), **macOS Apple Silicon** (`aarch64-apple-darwin`), and **macOS Intel** (`x86_64-apple-darwin`). Other targets need a local build (or your own packaging).

### Build from source

Everything under **Runtime**, plus:

- **Rust**: Stable toolchain (`rustup` default stable is fine).
- **Linux build deps**: ALSA headers and `pkg-config` — e.g. Debian/Ubuntu `libasound2-dev` + `pkg-config`, Fedora `alsa-lib-devel`, Arch `alsa-lib` (provides what `alsa-sys` needs via pkg-config).

---

## Installation

Current options are:

[Binaries](#binary-releases-linux-x86_64-macos)
[AUR](#arch-linux-aur)
[crates.io](#cratesio)
[Homebrew](#macos-homebrew)
[From source](#build-from-source-1).


### Binary Releases (Linux x86_64, macOS)

Download the `.tar.gz` for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/acmagn/ratune/releases).
Extract and put `ratune` on your `PATH`.

### Arch Linux (AUR)

Install the **`-bin`** package with an AUR helper, e.g.:

```bash
yay -S ratune-bin
# or: paru -S ratune-bin
```

[ratune-bin on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ratune-bin) ships the same Linux binary as GitHub Releases.

### crates.io

```sh
cargo install ratune
```

This **builds** from the published crate. You need a **Rust toolchain**; on **Linux**, install ALSA **development** packages first (same as [Build from source](#build-from-source)).

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew tap acmagn/tap
brew install ratune
```

### Build from source

Use this when you want the latest git checkout, you’re on an OS/arch without a prebuilt, or you’re developing Ratune.

**Linux:** install ALSA headers and `pkg-config` *before* the first build:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libasound2-dev pkg-config

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel pkg-config

# Arch
sudo pacman -S alsa-lib
```

**Clone and build:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acmagn/ratune.git
cd ratune
cargo build --release
```

The binary is `target/release/ratune`. Check the build with `ratune --version` (or `-V`).

**Album art in the terminal:** from a source checkout you can run a small [ratatui-image](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui-image) harness (same capability query as the real UI) to verify your terminal or tmux passthrough. Use any JPEG/PNG (etc.) on disk:

```sh
# Cargo workspace root (this repo layout)
cargo run -p ratune --example art_image_test -- /path/to/cover.jpg

# Or from the ratune/ crate directory only
cargo run --example art_image_test -- /path/to/cover.jpg
```

Press `q` or Esc to exit.

## Configuration

On first start, ratune creates a short default file at `~/.config/ratune/config.toml` (server fields plus common UI defaults). For every key with comments, use the sample file and copy the sections you need: [`docs/sample-config.toml`](docs/sample-config.toml).

Set Subsonic URL and username. For the secret you can either put it in the file (**plaintext**) or leave **`password` empty** (**default**) and use the OS keyring:

**Plaintext in config:**

```toml
[server]
url = "https://your-navidrome.example.com"
username = "you"
password = "your_password"
```

**Keyring (default starter config):** leave `password = ""`. The app uses [`keyring-core`](https://crates.io/crates/keyring-core) with a platform store: [**kernel keyutils**](https://docs.rs/linux-keyutils-keyring-store/latest/linux_keyutils_keyring_store/) on Linux (no Secret Service, D-Bus, or gnome-keyring), **Keychain** on macOS, **Credential Manager** on Windows. Linux uses the in-kernel keyring ([persistence and lifetimes](https://docs.rs/linux-keyutils-keyring-store/latest/linux_keyutils_keyring_store/#persistence)); a reboot clears keys, so you may be prompted again after restart. On first run you are prompted (via [inquire](https://crates.io/crates/inquire)); the secret is stored under service **`ratune`** and user **`{url}|{username}`** (not in `config.toml`). If the store cannot be opened (e.g. restricted container), you get a session-only prompt — use **`SUBSONIC_PASS`** or **`password`** in config. On macOS/Windows you can remove the saved login from the usual credential UI; on Linux, clearing happens on reboot or when kernel keyring entries expire per the docs linked above.

Subsonic auth uses a random salt per request and `MD5(secret + salt)` ([Navidrome / Subsonic API](https://www.navidrome.org/docs/developers/subsonic-api/)).

### Environment overrides (optional)

Overrides the config file when set:

```sh
export SUBSONIC_URL="https://your-server.example.com"
export SUBSONIC_USER="admin"
export SUBSONIC_PASS="your_password"
```

`TERMUSIC_SUBSONIC_*` variants are also accepted (see sample config).

### Snippets: player, cache, theme, fzf

```toml
[player]
default_volume = 70
max_bit_rate = 0

[cache]
enabled = true
max_size_gb = 2

[ui]
# Only `album_art_backend` lives here; NP strip/queue/toggles → `[ui.nptab]`, `[ui.row_now_playing]`, …

[theme]
preset = "dynamic"

[library]
# enabled, index path, fzf binary, fzf args, …  → see sample-config.toml
```

Remapping is done in `[keybinds]`; colors in `[theme]`; now-playing strip vs queue are different keys — see the sample and in-app help (`i`).

### Folder navigation (Browse)

When enabled, the Browse tab can switch between the usual artist / album / track columns and a folder layout that mirrors how your server organizes files on disk (or per-library roots). This uses the Subsonic APIs `getMusicFolders`, `getIndexes`, and `getMusicDirectory` (tested with Navidrome and [gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic)).

**Enable in config** (`[ui.browsetab]` in [`docs/sample-config.toml`](docs/sample-config.toml)):

```toml
[ui.browsetab]
folder_navigation = true
# mode = "artists"   # default on startup (default)
# mode = "files"     # start in folder view when folder_navigation is true
```

**Toggle at runtime:** default **`Ctrl+b`** (`toggle_folder_browse` in `[keybinds]`). Switches between folder view and artist browsing and jumps to the Browse tab. If you start in `files` mode, the first toggle to artists loads the artist list if it was not fetched yet.

## Default keybinds

These are defaults; everything is overridable in `config.toml`. Press `i` in the app for the list that matches your file.

| `Enter` | Open / play |
| `a` / `A` | Add track / add all |
| `p` / `Space` | Play / pause |
| `n` / `N` | Next / previous |
| `x` / `z` | Shuffle / unshuffle |
| `+` / `-` | Volume |
| `←` / `→` | Seek (Now playing) |
| `/` | Search |
| `L` | Lyrics |
| `V` | Visualizer |
| `P` | Playlist overlay (Browse) |
| `>` | Add to playlist (Browse) |
| `Ctrl+f` | Library fzf picker (if configured) |
| `Ctrl+b` | Toggle folder / artist browse (if `[ui.browsetab] folder_navigation = true`) |
| `t` | Toggle dynamic theme |
| `i` | Help |
| `q` | Quit |

### Fuzzy finder

Full-library fzf (or sk) flow.

**Library metadata required for fuzzy finding to work properly.** Enable it and configure refresh/arguments under `[library]` in [`docs/sample-config.toml`](docs/sample-config.toml). Ratune will then fill the library metadata. It can take a few minutes and fuzzy finding will be unavailble during that time, please be patient!

### Customization

Theme, layout, now-playing lines, queue row template, tab bar, and more are configured in `config.toml` (see the sample config).
